A chatbox widget to add to your Twitch overlay.
This project was written for learning purpose and may or may not become usable eventually.

## Installation

Install project's dependencies using the `yarn` command.

You need to create a table in Supabase using this snippet:
```
create table
  public.tokens (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    accessToken text not null,
    expiresIn numeric null,
    obtainmentTimestamp numeric not null,
    refreshToken text null,
    scope json not null,
    constraint tokens_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` or `.env.development` and fill it with your own credentials.
See Supabase and twurple documentations to learn how to get them.

You may then run the widget. For testing purpose, use the `yarn dev` command to run it in developer mode.
You'll get a local url in your terminal that should look like `http://localhost:5173`. Copy it.

In OBS, add a new web browser source to your scene. Paste in the url you copied earlier and add your channel id as a hash at the end.
In my case, the final URL would look like this `http://localhost:5173/#hommeoursporc`
